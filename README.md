hey Friends, this is my fourth techdegree project - Store Inventory with SQLAlchemy.

This is a simple programm that users can:

- view all the inventory products;
- view the inventory product by its ID;
- backup the database;
- update a product;
- add a new product;
- delete a product by its ID;

The user can nevigate it with giving the menu code to the programm.
This is not easy, especially regarding the ORM methods, and how to keep
the program running and displaying the correct data.

Keep learning and keep pushing forward!!

README info for revised project:

- cleaned the formats to name, price, quantity, date udpated, before used;
- add check for empty string of name input, means the name input cannot be emptry;
- raised error exceptions when the enter input in the invalid data;
- added exit option if user wants to exit the program;
- the database would remove repeated name of product and fetch the latest product when loading;
- when user add a new product, but the product name is already in database, the database will replace the newly added product with the old one;


Keep learning and keep pushing forward!!!
