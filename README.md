hey Friends, this is my fourth techdegree project - Store Inventory with SQLAlchemy.

This is a simple programm that users can:

- view all the inventory products;
- view the inventory product by its ID;
- backup the database;
- update a product;
- add a new product;
- delete a product by its ID;

The user can nevigate it with giving the menu code to the programm.
This is not easy, especially regarding the ORM methods, and how to keep
the program running and displaying the correct data.

Keep learning and keep pushing forward!!
